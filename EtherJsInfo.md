# Ether.js - A JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

Normal Apps have Server, Database ,API's etc acting as a __BACKEND__ Structure .
But in Blockchain Apps, called Dapps(Decentralized Applications) , Smart Contracts and Blockchain are the __BACKEND__ Structure.

A blockchain have lots of nodes and each node contains same data,  we can interact with one of the nodes from our client(website,frontend, offchain backend etc)
To connect blockchain node with our client we use bridge, and ETHER.JS library acts as a bridge

To let our dapps be functionable on the blockchain,we need to connect it to one of the nodes of the blockchain.
Manually setting up a node ourselves is too hectic of a process and will be overkill for us , but there are tools available that gives us APi's (JSON RPC) to connect to the nodes of the blockchain directly without setting up the nodes ourselves.e.g, infura,alchemy etc

 __what is wait() ?__ 
 __wait() is a method of the transaction object, which waits for the transaction to be mined.__
 __wait() is coming from the ethers library.__
